# 2023-01-09-WinSock

- A Winsock backend following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dquxuXeZXgo). I have also made it into a CMake project as I don't use visual studio.
- The project consist of a TCP chat server and also a TCP web sersver.
- For web server I have implemented a naive routing for fun:
